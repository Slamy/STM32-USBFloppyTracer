# TODO

* Add documentation.
* Fix the thousand TODOs in the code
* Add Disk Change detection (Forever mode?)
	* Especially interesting for reading
* Fix soft lockups
* Check Windows build (it might not work at all)
* Support for Shugart Bus pinout
	* Not really important though.
* Virtual Block device so the disk can be mounted under linux for file access
