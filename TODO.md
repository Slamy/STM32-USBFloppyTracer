# TODO

* Add documentation.
* Fix the thousand TODOs in the code
    * Remove residuals of significance detection code in track_raw
    * Fix similarity detection for all disk types. Must depend on format.
* Add Disk Change detection (Forever mode?)
* Fix soft lockups
* Significance Offset doesn't work correctly with ISO format as the Gap is detected as significance and the signal auto correlates.
