# STM32-USBFloppyTracer

Raw Floppy Writer using STM32F4Discovery board. Supports Amiga and C64 Images. Even copy protected!
This is a remake of my [older project](https://github.com/Slamy/SlamySTM32Floppy) as I wanted to learn Rust and needed a project to do so.
Also I don't like my old code base any more and wanted to have a cleaner software architecture.

## Compatibility and Differences to old project

This project is 100% pin compatible with the [older version](https://github.com/Slamy/SlamySTM32Floppy).
There is no need to resolder the old setup.

### Improvements to the old project:

* USB transfer and Floppy writing is done in parallel. Faster process.
* Every track now verified after being written. Even raw images.
* The project is rewritten in Rust and therefore oxidized.

### Features still missing from the old project:

* Reading of disk images
* Flippy disk
* Writing of ISO Format / IBM System 34
    * Required for Atari ST (.st) and Amstrad CPC (.dsk) images

## How to connect the STM32F4Discovery board to the disk drive

## How to build and flash the firmware

	cd firmware
	cargo embed --release

## How to build and install the tool

	cargo build --release
	cargo install --path tool/

## Why not use the Greaseweazle or the Kryoflux?

I had to ask myself this question during the start of this project in fall 2022. My [SlamySTM32Floppy](https://github.com/Slamy/SlamySTM32Floppy) was never changed since 2018. And even that year is wrong as the project matured during 2016 but wasn't directly uploaded at that time. It is now a long time ago and new players have entered the match. The [Greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle) seems to be a very affordable solution for most users and can be bought preassembled and ready to go for an affordable price.
Even older but maybe also sufficient is the [Kryoflux](https://kryoflux.com/). But that device is rather pricy for some people.

In the end, I just love floppy disks and wanted to use this project to learn Rust but also improve the software architecture of the old project. So I decided to give it another shot.

## Usage

Help is provided by the tool itself

    usbfloppytracer -h

Assuming drive A is a 3.5" drive: Writing of Amiga images

    usbfloppytracer -a Turrican.adf 
    usbfloppytracer -a Turrican.ipf 

Assuming drive B is a 5Â¼" drive: Writing of C64 images

    usbfloppytracer -b Katakis_s1.g64
    usbfloppytracer -b 'Katakis_(CPX).d64'


### Supported disk image formats:

* .adf
* .ipf
* .d64
* .g64

## Copy protected images which have been checked and are supported by this tool

Quality can vary between raw images. Writing and verification of .g64 and .ipf images is not guaranteed.
Therefore I try to keep a list of images which are expected to work with this software.
